# Exercise 1: Simple Prompt Writing

## Objective
Write your first prompts and observe outputs. Learn how different prompt styles affect AI responses.

**Tools needed:** OpenAI Playground, ChatGPT, or Claude

---

## Part 1: Direct Instruction Prompt

### What is a direct instruction prompt?
A clear command telling the AI exactly what to do.

### Task: Write a direct instruction prompt

**My prompt:**
<!-- TODO: Write a direct instruction. Example:
"List three programming languages"
or
"Name five fruits"
or
"Write the first 10 even numbers"
-->

**AI's response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste what the AI said. Example:
1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Java
-->

**What I notice about this response:**
<!-- TODO: What do you observe? Example:
- The AI gave me exactly 3 items like I asked
- It used a numbered list format
- The answers are clear and simple
- No extra explanation, just the list
-->

---

## Part 2: Question Style Prompt

### What is a question style prompt?
Asking the AI a question instead of giving a command.

### Task: Write a question style prompt

**My prompt:**
<!-- TODO: Write a question. Example:
"What are the benefits of Python for AI?"
or
"Why is exercise important?"
or
"How does a computer work?"
-->

**AI's response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste what the AI said. Example:
Python is great for AI because:
1. It has many libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch
2. The syntax is simple and easy to learn
3. It has a large community...
-->

**What I notice about this response:**
<!-- TODO: What do you observe? Example:
- The AI explained things, not just listed
- It gave reasons and details
- The answer is longer than the direct instruction
- It tried to be helpful and informative
-->

---

## Part 3: Comparison - Direct vs Question

### Side by side comparison:

**Topic to test:** <!-- TODO: Choose a topic. Example: "programming languages" or "healthy food" -->

**Direct instruction I used:**
<!-- TODO: Example: "List three programming languages" -->

**Question I used:**
<!-- TODO: Example: "What are good programming languages to learn?" -->

### Results:

**Direct instruction response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste AI response -->

**Question response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste AI response -->

### Differences I noticed:

**Length:**
<!-- TODO: Which was longer? Example:
Question style gave much longer response with explanations. Direct was short and to the point.
-->

**Style:**
<!-- TODO: How did the tone differ? Example:
Question style felt more conversational and helpful. Direct was more like a list or fact sheet.
-->

**Detail level:**
<!-- TODO: Which had more details? Example:
Question included reasons WHY things are good. Direct just gave the things.
-->

**Which I prefer and why:**
<!-- TODO: Your preference. Example:
I like question style when I want to learn something because it explains. I like direct style when I just need quick facts or a list.
-->

## Part 4: Experimenting with Specificity

### Test 1: Vague prompt

**My vague prompt:**
<!-- TODO: Write something unclear. Example:
"Tell me about dogs"
or
"Explain computers"
-->

**AI's response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste response -->

**Problem with this response:**
<!-- TODO: What was unclear or too broad? Example:
The AI talked about many things - dog breeds, behavior, history. I didn't know what part I actually wanted. Too much random information.
-->

### Test 2: Specific prompt

**My specific version of the same prompt:**
<!-- TODO: Make it more specific. Example:
"List 3 popular dog breeds for families with small children"
or
"Explain what RAM does in a computer in one sentence"
-->

**AI's response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste response -->

**Why this is better:**
<!-- TODO: Compare to vague version. Example:
Now AI knows exactly what I want - dog breeds for families, not dog history. The answer is focused and useful. I got what I needed without extra stuff.
-->

---

## Part 5: Testing Different Instructions

### Experiment: Same topic, different instructions

**Topic:** <!-- TODO: Choose. Example: "pizza" or "exercise" or "books" -->

**Instruction 1:** List
<!-- TODO: Example: "List 5 pizza toppings" -->

**AI response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste -->

---

**Instruction 2:** Explain
<!-- TODO: Example: "Explain how pizza is made" -->

**AI response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste -->

---

**Instruction 3:** Compare
<!-- TODO: Example: "Compare thin crust and thick crust pizza" -->

**AI response:**
<!-- TODO: Paste -->

---

### What I learned:

**The verb matters:**
<!-- TODO: Observation. Example:
"List" gives me bullet points. "Explain" gives me a process or reasons. "Compare" shows differences. Same topic but totally different answers based on the instruction word!
-->

---

## Part 6: Reflection and Analysis

### Key insights from this exercise:

**1. How does prompt style affect the response?**
<!-- TODO: Your observation. Example:
Questions make AI explain more. Direct commands give shorter, focused answers. The way I ask changes what I get back.
-->

**2. What makes a good prompt?**
<!-- TODO: Your thoughts. Example:
Being specific helps a lot. Using clear instruction words like "list" or "explain" guides the AI. Knowing what kind of answer I want helps me write better prompts.
-->

**3. When would I use direct instructions vs questions?**
<!-- TODO: Your strategy. Example:
Direct: When I need quick facts or lists
Questions: When I want to understand something or need explanations
Both can work but for different goals!
-->

**4. What surprised me?**
<!-- TODO: Any surprises. Example:
I was surprised how much difference a small change makes. Just adding "for families with children" completely changed the dog breed suggestions.
-->

## Summary

### Best practices I learned:

1. <!-- TODO: Example: Be specific about what you want -->

2. <!-- TODO: Example: Choose direct instruction or question based on the type of answer you need -->

3. <!-- TODO: Example: Use clear action words (list, explain, compare, describe) -->

4. <!-- TODO: Example: Test and refine if the first answer isn't what you wanted -->

### My favorite prompt from this exercise:
<!-- TODO: Which prompt worked best and why? -->
