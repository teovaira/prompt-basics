# Prompt Basics - Prompt Piscine

## Overview

This project is about learning the fundamentals of prompting Large Language Models (LLMs). You will learn what a prompt is, how to structure prompts properly, and how different parameters affect AI responses.

**Key Topics:**
- What is a prompt and its anatomy (system, user, assistant messages)
- Zero-shot vs few-shot prompting
- How to generate consistent outputs with simple prompts
- How parameters like temperature and top-p affect model behavior

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and components of a prompt
- Distinguish between zero-shot and few-shot prompting
- Practice generating consistent outputs with simple prompts
- Explore how parameters like temperature and top-p affect model behavior

## Exercises

- **Exercise 0**: Environment and Libraries - Set up Python development environment
- **Exercise 1**: Simple Prompt Writing - Write your first prompts and observe outputs
- **Exercise 2**: Instruction Refinement - Convert vague requests into precise prompts
- **Exercise 3**: Parameter Experimentation - Understand how parameters affect output diversity

## Virtual Environment

- OpenAI Playground or ChatGPT interface
- Python 3.9+ installed locally (optional, for simulating API workflows)

## Important Notes

For each exercise, you must provide:
- The prompts you used
- Model outputs you received
- Brief sentence analysis highlighting differences in output, clarity, or behavior

This project helps you understand how to communicate effectively with AI models and control their behavior through prompt engineering.
