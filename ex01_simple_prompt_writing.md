### Task 2: Write a question style prompt

**My prompt:**
"How does a computer work?"


**AI's response:**
A computer works by following instructions to process information using electrical signals. At its core, a computer operates on binary code—sequences of 1s and 0s that represent different pieces of data or commands.
The central processing unit (CPU) acts as the computer's brain, executing billions of calculations per second. When you interact with a computer, your input gets translated into binary instructions that the CPU can understand. The CPU fetches these instructions from memory, decodes what they mean, executes the operations, and stores the results.
Memory plays a crucial role in this process. RAM (random access memory) temporarily holds the data and programs you're currently using, allowing quick access. Storage drives (like SSDs or hard drives) keep your files and programs permanently, even when the computer is off.
All these components communicate through the motherboard, which acts like a highway system connecting different parts. The power supply provides electricity to run everything, while input devices like keyboards and mice let you send commands, and output devices like monitors display the results.
What makes computers powerful is their speed and ability to perform complex sequences of simple operations. Every action—from opening a file to playing a video—breaks down into millions of these basic electrical operations happening incredibly fast, creating the seamless experience you see on screen.
